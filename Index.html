    <p class="dotted">
        The Mughal Empire was an early-modern empire that<br>
        <sup>controlled much of South Asia between the 16th <br>
         and 19th centuries.[11] For some two hundred years,<br>
          <b>the empire stretched from the outer fringes of the Indus</b> <br>
          river basin in the west, northern Afghanistan in the northwest,<br>
           and Kashmir in the north, to the highlands of present-day<br>
            Assam and Bangladesh in the east, and the uplands of the <br>
            Deccan plateau in south India

        <del>The Mughal Empire was founded by Babur (reigned 1526–1530),</del> <br>
        a Central Asian ruler who was descended from the Turco-Mongol <br>
        <sub> Timur (the founder of the Timurid Empire) on his</sub> <br>
        father's side, and from Genghis Khan on his mother's side.[43]<br>
         <i><b> from his ancestral domains in Central Asia,</b></i> <br>
         Babur turned to India to satisfy his ambitions.[44]<br>
          <abbr> established himself in Kabul and then pushed steadily</abbr><br>
         southward into India from Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass.
